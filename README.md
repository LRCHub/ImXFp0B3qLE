[00:09.42] Every day I go to a school
[00:12.09] That likes to help with learnin'
[00:13.83] One, two, threes, they're the keys
[00:16.16] Basic math, very easy
[00:18.64] To Baldi's world of fun
[00:20.78] Where no one leaves 'til educated
[00:23.03] Every door is locked up tight
[00:25.32] Stay inside, 'til we're graded
[00:40.32] 
[00:28.04] The students try their best to
[00:30.10] Better their education
[00:32.38] Comprehend the material
[00:34.48] Study hard, relay every detail
[00:36.92] Nobody wants detention
[00:39.33] We only want attention
[00:41.52] Even when life is tough
[00:43.71] Oddly quarters are enough
[00:56.21] 
[00:46.39] This is how we live our lives searchin'
[00:50.51] For the answers inside of every page
[00:54.13] And I'm here wonderin' if one day
[00:58.97] We'll finally be free from this cage
[01:03.55] Is it okay to have a feelin'
[01:08.02] That maybe there is more to this game?
[01:12.62] However now, no time to question
[01:17.09] So just behave
[01:24.09] 
[01:36.49] Walking across the hallways
[01:38.60] Finding notebooks so we matter
[01:40.93] Follow every single rule
[01:42.96] Or he'll take out his wooden ruler
[01:45.56] For he is listenin', and
[01:47.59] Watchin' everyone's progression
[01:49.92] All mistakes have consequences
[01:52.28] So, answer right with every question
[02:10.28] 
[01:54.78] Try to add up excuses
[01:56.96] Nothing will make a difference
[01:59.03] Baldi knows every door that we open
[02:01.33] Followin' from behind, we can hear him
[02:03.34] There is no place for playtime
[02:06.17] Avoid them all from every side
[02:08.45] Better to leave him be
[02:10.79] Follow his philosophy
[02:21.29] 
[02:12.98] This is how we live our lives searchin'
[02:17.14] For the answers inside of every page
[02:21.06] And I'm here wonderin' if one day
[02:25.50] We'll finally be free from this cage
[02:30.27] Is it okay to have a feelin'
[02:34.98] That maybe there is more to this game?
[02:39.21] However now, just keep behaving
[02:54.71] 
[02:44.77] Sweep through the halls
[02:46.70] To escape will have some sacrifices
[02:49.35] No room for jealousy
[02:51.54] I've got no time to play hide and seek
[02:55.65] 'Cause eventually he'll surely find me
[02:58.67] Have to be brave or better keep behavin'
[03:18.67] 
[03:03.17] Count 'til I don't know what counts
[03:06.94] Every inch of fear is all that's ingrained
[03:11.17] Can't understand, what's the solution?
[03:15.97] The problem is the mess in my brain
[03:20.48] I'm pushed around with all the pressure
[03:25.33] To be here when I don't wanna stay
[03:29.43] There's gotta be some sort of exit
[03:33.88] To get away
